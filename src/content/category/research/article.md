# Infrastructure as Artistic Practice

Infrastructure as Artistic Practice is a concept that explores the intersection of art and infrastructure, where the
creation, maintenance, and evolution of infrastructure are approached with an artistic lens. This practice emphasizes
the aesthetic, cultural, and social dimensions of infrastructure, transforming it into a medium for artistic expression
and community engagement.
